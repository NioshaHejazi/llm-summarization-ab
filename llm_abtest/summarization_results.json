We teamed up with Gateway Community College to build the Advanced Cyber Systems Lab. A lot of tech groups in Phoenix meet at varying locations, because they can’t afford or find a dedicated space. TEC hosts community technology-focused groups at the Advanced Cyber Systems Lab, so they can have the proper equipment to work on and collaborate on their projects. Speaking of projects, let's talk about some of the main priorities of TEC: right to repair, privacy, and cybersecurity. Having the only right to repair hub in the greater Phoenix metro valley, what concerns do you see on the horizon? One of our big concerns is that many companies have slowly shifted away from repairability to a sense of convenience. We are thankful for the donations from iFixIt that allow people to use the tools they may otherwise not know they need or could afford. Community members and IT professionals have come to use our anti-static benches to fix everything from TVs to 3D printers. We are also starting to host ‘Hardware Happy Hour’ so anyone can bring their hardware projects in and socialize with like-minded people. How’s your privacy and cybersecurity work resonating wit",

Booking.com, applicable when someone uses valid login credentials to access information to which those credentials provide access. Now that the case is on appeal, EFF has filed an amicus brief asking the Third Circuit to clarify that this case is about violations to policy, not hacking, and does not qualify as access “without authorization” under CFAA. The case concerns transparency in airfare pricing. Ryanair complained that Booking republished Ryanair’s prices, some of which were only visible when a user logged in. Ryanair sent a cease and desist to Booking, but didn't deactivate the usernames and passwords associated with the uses they disliked. When the users allegedly connected to Booking kept using those credentials to gather pricing data, Ryanair claimed it was a CFAA violation. If this doesn’t sound like “computer hacking” to you, you’re right. The CFAA has proven bad for research, security, competition, and innovation. For years we’ve worked to limit its scope to Congress’s original intention: actual hacking that bypasses computer security. It should have nothing to do with Ryanair’s claims here: what amounts to a terms of use violation because the information that was accessed is available to anyone with login credentials. This is the course charted Van Buren v. United States, where the Supreme Court explained that “authorization” refers to technical concepts of computer authentication. As we stated in our brief: The CFAA does not apply to every person who merely violates terms of service by sharing account credentials with a family member or by withholding sensitive information like one’s real name and birthdate when making an account.

    "input_text": "If you thought going to a Pride event or drag show was just another night out, think again. If you were in Florida, it might land your name in a government database. That’s what’s happening in Vero Beach, FL, where the Florida Attorney General’s office has subpoenaed a local restaurant, The Kilted Mermaid, demanding surveillance video, guest lists, reservation logs, and contracts of performers and other staff—all because the venue hosted an LGBTQ+ Pride event. To be clear: no one has been charged with a crime, and the law Florida is likely leaning on here—the so-called “Protection of Children Act” (which was designed to be a drag show ban)—has already been blocked by federal courts as likely unconstitutional. But that didn’t stop Attorney General James Uthmeier from pushing forward anyway. Without naming a specific law that was violated, the AG’s press release used pointed and accusatory language, stating that \"In Florida, we don't sacrifice the innocence of children for the perversions of some demented adults.” His office is now fishing for personal data about everyone who attended or performed at the event. This should set off every civil liberties alarm bell we have. Just like the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and other bills with misleading names, this isn’t about protecting children. It’s about using the power of the state to intimidate people government officials disagree with, and to censor speech that is both lawful and fundamental to American democracy. Drag shows—many of which are family-friendly and feature no sexual content—have become a political scapegoat. And while that rhetoric might resonate in some media environments, the real-world consequences are much darker: state surveillance of private citizens doing nothing but attending a fun community celebration. By demanding video surveillance, guest lists, and reservation logs, the state isn’t investigating a crime, it is trying to scare individuals from attending a legal gathering. These are people who",

    "input_text": "By publishing its guidelines under Article 28 of the Digital Services Act, the European Commission has taken a major step towards social media bans that will undermine privacy, expression, and participation rights for young people that are already enshrined in international human rights law. EFF recently submitted feedback to the Commission’s consultation on the guidelines, emphasizing a critical point: Online safety for young people must include privacy and security for them and must not come at the expense of freedom of expression and equitable access to digital spaces. Article 28 requires online platforms to take appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure a high level of safety, privacy and security of minors on their services. But the article also prohibits targeting minors with personalized ads, a measure that would seem to require that platforms know that a user is a minor. The DSA acknowledges that there is an inherent tension between ensuring a minor’s privacy and requiring platforms to know the age of every user. The DSA does not resolve this tension. Rather, it states that service providers should not be incentivized to collect the age of their users, and Article 28(3) makes a point of not requiring service providers to collect and process additional data to assess whether a user is underage. Thus, the question of age checks is a key to understanding the obligations of online platforms to safeguard minors online. Our submission explained the serious concerns that age checks pose to the rights and security of minors. All methods for conducting age checks come with serious drawbacks. Approaches to verify a user’s age generally involve some form of government-issued ID document, which millions of people in Europe—including migrants, members of marginalized groups and unhoused people, exchange students, refugees and tourists—may not have access to.

The digital ID systems currently being introduced potentially solve some problems like identity fraud for business and government services, but leave the holder of the digital ID vulnerable to the needs of the companies collecting such information.

It’s a Trojan horse for U.S. law enforcement—quietly building the pipes to ship Canadians’ private data straight to Washington. If Bill C-2 passes, Canadian police and spy agencies will be able to demand information about peoples’ online activities based on the low threshold of “reasonable suspicion.” Companies holding such information would have only five days to challenge an order, and blanket immunity from lawsuits if they hand over data.
